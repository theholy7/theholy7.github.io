## About

Welcome to my blog.

This is where I will be posting what I learn and like.

Hope you can find something useful here.

As for me, I am a physicist turned "Junior Data X"

(`X in ['miner', 'engineer', 'scientist']`).

Portuguese, born in 1991, and with a lot of passion for trave, food, and learning.

Enjoy,

Jose
