Welcome to my blog.
This is where I will be posting what I learn and like.
Hope you can find something useful here.
My name is Jose Antunes and I am a physicist turned Backend Developer/Data Engineer.

I used to be a Backend Developer/Data Miner/everything at CognitionX, and at Cytora.
I am now working at Splend!

Final details: I am Portuguese, born in 1991, and with a lot of passion for travel, food, and learning.
I moved to London in November 2016, and plan on building a good career here, learning from the best people
and aiming to change the world! Because startups here have a global mindset, and I love working in startups!

Hope you enjoy my blog, Jose :)
