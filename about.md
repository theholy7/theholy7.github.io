Welcome to my blog.
This is where I will be posting what I learn and like.
Hope you can find something useful here.
My name is Jose Antunes and I am a physicist turned Backend Developer/Data Engineer.

I have worn a few different hats:
* Data Miner
* Backend Developer
* Data Engineer
* Data Wizzard

And I have previously worked at:
* CognitionX
* Cytora
* Splend
* Cable

Currently I work at **REDACTED**.

Final details: I am Portuguese/British, and have a lot of passion for climbing, travel, food, and learning.
I moved to London in November 2016, and plan on building a good career here, learning from the best people
and aiming to change the world! Because startups here have a global mindset, and I love working in startups!

Hope you enjoy my blog, Jose :)
