Take this post with a **teaspoon** of salt. It reflects my own experience in remote organisations, your mileage may vary.
With that out of the way, lets get started.

TL;DR:
  * Focus on your onboarding, it has to be meaningful and crafted with intention
    * A newcommer should have sessions about the company, market, and strategy
    * Their first week should have meetings that touch all the important parts of the company
    * Their sessions should have a clear agenda, and clear owners
    * They can have a buddy assigned to help them navigate their first week / work
  * Document everything, knowledge should be shared and there shouldn't be "that person that knows about it"
    * Documentation needs to be a part of the work process and the definition of done
    * Everyone should contribute to documentation without fear - by editing directly, or asking questions
  * Promote good culture, encourage people to connect
    * Allow virtual coffees or virtual meals
    * Trust your employees to do their job and take the right decision

To give some context, I have been working remotely since COVID-19. Granted it's not long, but 5 years and three companies later I have seen a few things:
  * Org-1: A fully in-office company that moved to WFH
  * Org-2: A fully remote company that was setup from day 1 like that
  * Org-3: A remote-first company that has an office you can visit if you want

In the spectrum of synchronous-asynchronous, they also fall into slightly different places:
  * Org-1: was fully synchronous, people were expected to work their timezone hours
  * Org-2: was mostly synchronous, but had many people in different timezones in EU and some in North America. There was also lots of personal life flexibility, meaning asynchronous work also happened
  * Org-3: was mostly synchronous too

I am writing this post because I keep seeing post after post of CEOs and People managers saying that returning to the office is the most important thing in the world.
The whole attitude seems to be like: _be there or be square_.

The most recent example I came accross was a post that said that for any intern or person at the start of their career, they *need* to be in the office for those "watercooler moments".
The claim being that those are the best networking moments, and the moments where the intern can learn.

But more generally, the arguments I see revolve around something like "increased bandwidth", "company culture", "the perks of being in an office".

While I don't dispute that there is more bandwidth when people talk in person, a lot has to be said about good culture,
and learning. Remote companies can be great places to work in, and provide valuable learning experineces.

The remote company only sees it's flaws enhanced, and that is why it needs to work hard to have good processes in place,
and make sure everyone is aligned.

This doesn't mean that *all* companies should be remote. But it does mean that when companies want to be remote, they can't just move their people into their own homes and hope for the best.

Out there, there are great software companies that are fully remote, that we can take inspiration from.
If they can be extremely successful under that model, why can'hope for the best.

Out there, there are great software companies that are fully remote, that we can take inspiration from.
If they can be extremely successful under that model, why can't others?

Look at: Automattic (Wordpress et al.), GitLab, Dropbox, Github, HashiCorp, etc..

Gitlab, for example, even provides [documentation](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/company/culture/all-remote/) about how they are remote.

Help is available, you can learn from others, and if in doubt ask for help.

## Onboarding

## Documentation

## Culture
[draft - onboarding]

Onboarding new talent into the company is a crucial part of its growth.
The goal is for them to hit the ground running because as a company we want them to provide value quickly.
However, we look at onboarding tasks as a checklist, and a hindrance on other productive members of the team.
We don't give onboarding nearly as much attention as we should.

This is espeically noticeable in remote companies, obviously. Noticeable because our face-to-face time is limited,
and the bandwidth we have for communication is smaller than in the office.
This should **not** serve as an excuse to move back to the office, it should serve as motivation to **improve**
the onboarding process. Where should we put our efforts in?

I think good onboarding hinges on three pillars: the intro meetings, the tools for the job, the documentation.

The intro meetings

The intro meetings should me more than a hello to colleague that works in a specific team / area.
Ideally they should have a standard that gets improved after each new hire.
The intro meetings should aim to build business and development context in the new hire.
This means talking about:
  * the company, its history and how we got to the current day.
  * our clients, current and prospective
  * strategic vision and goals
