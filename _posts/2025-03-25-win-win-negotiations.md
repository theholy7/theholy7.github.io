I have recently watched a video on ["The 7 Myths of Win-Win Negotiations" by Professor Horacio Falcão](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6tTgT6h8gI). I have a lot to learn.

This lecture was recommended to me by a friend that had the pleasure of doing a workshop based on Prof. Falcão's method.
Not only was my friend impressed by what he learned, he claimed that the course paid itself back after the first closed
contract.

I feel like I have been very lucky everytime that I negotiated a new job.
I got more or less what I wanted, but have I gotten all I could have gotten? I don't know.
I feel like I am bad at negotiating, usually revealing way too much way too soon.
I always say I am too transparent.

The first few minutes of the talk were eye-opening. In a way they felt like a personal attack - some of my regular
behaviours being highlighted. What I thought were good habits of negotiating were wrong, according to this framework.
Lets dive into the notes I took during this video.

Prof. Falcão describes two types of negotiations:
* Win-Lose Negotiations
* Win-Win Negotiations

In Win-Lose Negotiations, power is used to get what you want. This is what we call strong arm tactics.
We have more power, more money, more resources, and we leverage our position to close a deal.
By the end of the process, one of the parties is not happy, would you be able to negotiate with them again?

Then there is Win-Win Negotiations. Before we dive into what we should do to run a win-win negotiation,
lets first discuss what people think it is.

Prof. Falcão shows some statistical data that highlights 7 behaviours people think are associated
with win-win negotiations. You should:

1. Trust others
2. Listen actively
3. Be transparent
4. Be nice, just give
5. Be fair
6. Be faithful, loyal
6. Commit to a win-win outcome

However, all of these behaviours are wrong, or limit your ability to negotiate.
These behaviours are positive, but they are naive.
Our goal is not to be an angel, it is to reach a win-win outcome for both parties.

Why are these behaviours **naive**?
For example, you might assume that by engaging in all these behaviours the other person will reciprocate.
What if they don't? What can you do? Will you be bitter, angry, frustrated?
That surely can't lead to a win-win outcome...

_Make no assumptions about reciprocation. You have to be positive, not naive._

Maybe a more realisting assumption is:
"They will lie to me, they will take advantage of me. Let me negotiate reciprocation, instead of expecting it."

So what are the myths of Win-win Negotiations and how do we get over them?

## Myth #1: Trust others

Mutualism - (kind of like interdependence)
- you don't need to like each other
- you don't need to trust each other
- but the interestes have to be aligned

How can I know if there is something in this for you?

Respect - you have the benefic of the doubt
Trust - I do things without data about how you act

## Myth #2: Listen Actively

A dog can listen, a negotiator learns. You're listening to ask questions that will let you learn.
What else is there that you don't know?

## Myth #3: Be transparent

Don't be transparent - it's too transparent, it's too much information. Sometimes it actively hurts you.

It's not helpful.

Be translucent - not everything comes through, just what is useful.

Job Interviews: how does this apply?

- You should share what helps.

## Myth #4: Be nice, just give

they might just get it and walk away.

Don't give, exchange. Give something, take something.

## Myth #5: Be fair

Don't be fair, build common meaning.

Things need to make sense to both sides.

## Myth #6: Be faithful, loyal

Don't be loyal, don't be blindly loyal. Be faithful to the process.

If you make enough good moves with this process, the sequence of good moves will take you to a place of more
value, and less risk. Don't panic and change when things are not working.

## Myth #7: Commit to a win-win outcome

Don't commit to an outcome, don't limit yourself.

We should commit to an effort. Commit to your behaviour.

## Lying and cheating



## ending thoughts

It's about being win-win, and how to be win-win. Stay positive, and not naive.
