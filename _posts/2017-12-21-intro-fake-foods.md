This is my first real project. I have a plan and I intend to stick to it. This project is called "Fake Foods" and is inspired by Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing and Generation, and the "fake news" concept that has taken over the world in 2017, especially after Trumps election.

### What is Fake Foods?

The plan for this project is to create recipes using AI. The point is not to discover new, amazing recipes, only to generate recipes that can be read and make sense. I will call these "Fake Recipes".

These recipes will be published in a website, and I want to see if it gets any traction at all and if people comment on them. The fake foods website will need to look real, and for that magic to happen, I will also add AI generated comments to each of the recipes.

At the end of the project, I want to have developed my skills in Data Mining, Data Cleaning, some Data Science and Machine Learning, and web development.

As deliverables, I intend to make available a model and API delivered (containerized with Docker) that people can use, supplying a title, or ingredients, and the API will generate a recipe. Is this doable? I don't know, but I will try.

### What is the plan?

For this to happen, I will take the following steps:

1. Scrape recipe URLs off several food websites;
2. Scrape the ingredients and methods each recipe has;
3. Explore the obtained data using best practice with [Data Science Cookie Cutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/);
4. Develop a Flask API to deliver the model created;
5. Containarize the app and release it into the world;
6. Develop the website to post all the fake food.

### Final thoughts

Slowly but surely I want to make this happen.

If you want to contribute, let me know!

Best,

Jose
